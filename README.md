# Framework E2E Selenium

This project is an end-to-end (E2E) testing framework built using Selenium and Python. 
It provides a robust setup for automating UI testing, integrating with CI/CD pipelines, and generating detailed reports.

## Features

- **Selenium-based Automation**: Robust implementation for browser automation and E2E testing.
- **Python Framework**: Built with Python using modern design principles.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Simplifies test script maintenance and improves readability.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with GitLab CI, Jenkins, or other CI tools.
- **Parallel Execution**: Supports running tests in parallel to save time.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed test reports.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Google Chrome and ChromeDriver
- pip (Python package manager)
